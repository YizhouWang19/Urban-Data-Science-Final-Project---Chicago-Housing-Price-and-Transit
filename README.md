Finding affordable housing with easy access to public transportation is a challenge in many cities. This study examines the correlation between median housing values and public transit accessibility in Chicago for 2018 and 2021. The aim is to provide insights into the relationship between transportation infrastructure, housing affordability, and urban development in Chicago.2 Problem StatementÂ 

Studies show a positive correlation between housing prices and proximity to public transit, though this can lead to the displacement of low-income residents. Contradictory findings indicate areas with high public transit might have lower-income populations, suggesting varied impacts based on socio-economic factors. The Hedonic Price Model is used to quantify the effect of transit proximity on housing prices.

The research explores how public transit accessibility affects housing prices, demographics, and economic characteristics within Chicago. It addresses the gap in understanding the localized impact of transit stations on housing prices and demographics during the Covid and post-Covid era. The hypothesis is that housing prices are positively correlated with public transportation density and influence demographic patterns and housing vacancy rates.
